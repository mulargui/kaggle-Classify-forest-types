Here are notes of ideas explored during the project
1. Created the basic Keras NN model
	Accuracy in Keras 82%
	336 in the leaderboard (0.676 score)
2. Incremented training data (90%) vs validation (10%)
	x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y,test_size=0.1)
	Accuracy in Keras 82%
	no improvement - cancelled
3.Added a second layer to the NN of the same size the first level
	model.add(Dense(units=num_features, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='normal'))
	Accuracy in Keras 85%
4.Added a second layer to the NN of half the size the first level
	model.add(Dense(units=num_features/2, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='normal'))
	Accuracy in Keras 83%
5.Added a second layer to the NN of double the size the first level
	model.add(Dense(units=num_features*2, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='normal'))
	Accuracy in Keras 89%
	341 in the leaderboard (0.71187 score)
